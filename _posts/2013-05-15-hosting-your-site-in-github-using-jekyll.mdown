title: Hosting Your Site on Github Using Jekyll
---

Some days ago I decided to create my personal site, and I was thinking
on what CMS should I use, given that most of the times I try to adopt and try new technologies
when I get into a new project, and this was certainly one, so since I had been working a lot with WordPress, I decided that this time I would use jekyll, which seems very popular, simple and what's better, can be hosted for free on GitHub.
